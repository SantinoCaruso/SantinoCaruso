# About me

I'm 15 years old and I'm from Argentina, South America.
I started programming in 2014 or 2015, watching some HTML and JS tutorials (I kept doing this for 3 years).
Then in 2017 I started learning C#/CS, but I'm not sure where the idea came from.
Currently my favourite programming language is C#, and probably javascript is the one that I do best, I think.
